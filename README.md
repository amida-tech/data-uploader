## data-uploader

The "data uploader" is a Chrome App that can download health records from MyHealtheVet and upload them to Amida's Data Reconciliation Engine (DRE).  You can also use the app to manually upload files to the DRE.

For MyHealtheVet Basic accounts, the app will download a Blue Button ASCII file and a PDF of your self reported information.

For MyHealtheVet Premium accounts, the app will download a Blue Button ASCII file and PDF of your basic information, and a CCD-formatted XML file and PDF with your advanced information.
